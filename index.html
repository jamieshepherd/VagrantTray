<p>VagrantTray is an easy to use Vagrant manager for Windows. It features a simple tray based GUI menu and keeps out of your way while you work on your projects with Vagrant. It's completely free and open-source, I'd love for you to use it or contribute towards making it better!</p>

<h3>
<a name="easy-to-get-started" class="anchor" href="#easy-to-get-started"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Easy to get started</h3>

<p>Just go to <strong>Add New</strong> and select a Vagrantfile. That's it.</p>

<h3>
<a name="manage-your-box" class="anchor" href="#manage-your-box"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Manage your box</h3>

<p>Some of the more popular vagrant commands in a simple menu including <strong>vagrant up</strong>, <strong>halt</strong>, <strong>reload</strong> and <strong>ssh</strong>. VagrantTray keeps the command line out of your way for the most part (unless you're using SSH) so you can quickly load your box and get on with your work.</p>

<h3>

<p>VagrantTray is really small, so there's really no downside to trying it out and having it around. It can (and should) become an integral part of your workflow.</p>

<p>VagrantTray was made by <a href="https://github.com/jamieshepherd" class="user-mention">@jamieshepherd</a> after being inspired by the work of Vagrant Manager for Mac OS X. You can check them out <a href="https://github.com/lanayotech/vagrant-manager/">here</a>. If you'd like to contribute, just fork away. This was mainly a learning project for me so I'm sure there is still a ton of work to be done if you're willing.</p>
