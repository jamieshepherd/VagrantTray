It features a simple tray based GUI menu and keeps out of your way while you work on your projects with Vagrant. It's completely free and open-source, I'd love for you to use it or contribute towards making it better!\r\n\r\n### Easy to get started\r\nJust go to **Add New** and select a Vagrantfile. That's it.\r\n\r\n### Manage your box\r\nSome of the more popular vagrant commands in a simple menu including **vagrant up**, **halt**, **reload** and **ssh**. VagrantTray keeps the command line out of your way for the most part (unless you're using SSH) so you can quickly load your box and get on with your work.\r\n\r\n### Lightweight\r\nVagrantTray is really small, so there's really no downside to trying it out and having it around. It can (and should) become an integral part of your workflow.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nVagrantTray was made by @jamieshepherd after being inspired by the work of Vagrant Manager for Mac OS X. You can check them out [here](https://github.com/lanayotech/vagrant-manager/). If you'd like to contribute, just fork away. This was mainly a learning project for me so I'm sure there is still a ton of work to be done if you're willing.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
